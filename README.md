# Delizious-Toolkit
## What?
Delizious Toolkit is an easy to use .NET library entirely written in C# that contains solutions to requirements I have faced in my (professional) life and provides ready-to-use components. I always strive for well-crafted and clean code with a solid API design (e.g. prefer composition over inheritance and favor factory methods over using constructors) and focus on object-functional programming paradigm. 

Further things to mention:
* Implementation is mostly based on [immutability](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2007/11/13/immutability-in-c-part-one-kinds-of-immutability/) and value semantics where applicable and useful
* Separation of object graph construction and application logic as discussed [here](http://googletesting.blogspot.de/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-decided-to.html) (by the way a very interesting article about writing testable code!)

If you like or use my work and you are interested in this kind of software development let's get in touch. :)
